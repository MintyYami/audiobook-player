<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

To run this project, download the ```app-debug.apk``` file from the *Final-Application* folder onto an Android device.

Alternatively, download the source code and use Android Studio and Kotlin to compile and run virtually on an emulator.

This application is specifically developed for and tested on a Pixel 5 device running Android 14 and Android API version 34. Deviation from these specifications may lead to unintended results.
